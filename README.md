# Landing Page

This project is part of my **Professional Front-End Web Development Nanodegree Program**

### Manipulating the DOM exercise.
Exercise programmatically builds navigation,
scrolls to anchors from navigation,
and highlights section in viewport upon scrolling.

Dependencies: `None`
JS Version: `ES2015/ES6`
JS Standard: `ESlint`

The project will be done as planned but there will be more features and functionality added as extra work.
